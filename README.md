# AoC_2025

This is the AoC repo of Dichterfred

Here I post my solutions to the AoC 2025 I will not make it trough all 12 days but I try.

## Day 1

Solution is not the prettiest but works


## Day 2 

Had to consult the subreddit only to find out that I had to use stoll() istead of stoi()


## Day 3

Did it first try but had a headache 


## Day 4

Had a struggle with that but in the end it worked but not only with code. My solution produced an error when it accessed a position of a sting smaler zero had to just bypass that by jumping over the one ocurance.
